trolling recreation of chrome::dino

Main game:
-	Background: Ground, forest, sky:
  o	Background speed,
  o	Background x position,
  o	Background y position.
-	Character: Dinosaur:
  o	Character speed,
  o	Character x position,
  o	Character y position,
  o	Character height,
  o	Character width,
  o	Handle event: jump, crouch.
    ÔÇß	You may need to check if the character is on the ground or if it has reached the maximum height that we will determine later.
    ÔÇß	If the character is on the ground, it can jump. It can also crouch too.
      ‚Ä¢	If the character jumps, gradually increase y position until it reaches the height limit. Then gradually decrease y position until it touches the ground.
      ‚Ä¢	If the character crouches, decrease its height by ¬Ω. Render character crouch texture.
-	Obstacles: Bird, cactus‚Ä¶
  o	Generate random obstacles,
    ÔÇß	You can save generated obstacles to a queue for better collision checking.
  o	Obstacle speed,
  o	Obstacle x position,
  o	Obstacle y position,
  o	Obstacle height,
  o	Obstacle width.
-	Pause menu (set all objects speed to 0)
    ÔÇß	You may need to save every object‚Äô speed before setting it to 0.
-	Check collision between character & obstacles.
    ÔÇß	So far, we have objects‚Äô position & size. Checking collision is a piece of cake. üòä
-	Game over menu (like pause but you don‚Äôt have to save objects‚Äô speed anymore):
  o	Replay button.
  o	Main menu button (the main menu will be added after gameplay is finished).

In the future:

-	How-to-play menu.
-	Creator information (credit).
-	Game UI:
  o	Pause button,
  o	Display score & high score.
    ÔÇß	The score is calculated by the final character x position.
    ÔÇß	You may need a file ‚Äúhigh score.txt‚Äù to save the overall high score so it cannot be reset in the next launch.
-	Game sound:
  o	Character jump sound,
  o	Game over sound,
  o	Click sound,
  o	Background music,
